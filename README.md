# Ellsp
> Elisp Language Server

[![CI Elisp](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/ellsp/actions/workflows/test-elisp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/ellsp/actions/workflows/test-elisp.yml)

This software is designed to be used with editors other than Emacs. If you are
an Emacs user already, I prefer you use Emacs directly.

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- [Eask](https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli)

## ðŸ’¾ Installation

Add these lines to your `Eask`-file:

```elisp
(source 'jcs-elpa)

(development
 (depends-on "ellsp"))
```

Then install the language server:

```sh
# Install ellsp package
$ eask install-deps --dev

# Install the language server
$ eask exec install-ellsp
```
