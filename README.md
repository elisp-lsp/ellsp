# Ellsp
> Elisp Language Server

[![CI Elisp](https://github.com/elisp-lsp/ellsp/actions/workflows/test-elisp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elisp-lsp/ellsp/actions/workflows/test-elisp.yml)

This software is designed to be used with editors other than Emacs. If you are
an Emacs user already, I prefer you use Emacs directly.

Here is the list of currently supported editors:

- [Emacs]() (`M-x ellsp-register`)
- [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jcs090218.Ellsp)

## üîß Prerequisites

Before installation, make sure you have all the following software installed!

- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [Eask](https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli)

## üíæ Installation

Add these lines to your `Eask`-file:

```elisp
(source 'jcs-elpa)

(development
 (depends-on "ellsp"))
```

Then install the language server:

```sh
# Install ellsp package.
$ eask install-deps --dev

# Install the proxy server.
$ eask exec install-ellsp
```

To test to see if the server installed successfully, execute the following command:

```sh
$ eask exec ellsp
```

If you see the following screen (no error), you successfully installed the language server! üéâü•≥

```sh
Updating environment variables... done v
Exporting environment variables... done v
18:45:59 [INFO ] Starting the language server...
```

*üîä P.S. Nothing output afterward because the language server is waiting for the
language client to connect!*

## üî¨ Development

To test the language server locally:

```sh
# Add link to current package
$ eask link add ellsp ./
```

Then follow the same steps as installation:

```sh
# Install the proxy server.
$ eask exec install-ellsp

# Test the language server.
$ eask exec ellsp
```
